## 📝 Problem Statement

**Personalized Learning Recommendation Based on Cognitive Profile Modeling**

***

### 1️⃣ Problem Description

🧠 Learners vary in cognitive abilities, memory, and pace.  
⚠️ Traditional recommendation based only on past scores is insufficient.  
🔗 Modeling cognitive profiles enables personalized learning paths.

***

### 2️⃣ Objectives

- 🧩 Build embeddings that capture cognitive attributes.
- 📚 Adaptively recommend learning content.
- 🎯 Improve retention and mastery.

***

### 3️⃣ Key Features

- 📝 Quiz logs, response times.
- 📊 Difficulty metadata.
- 🔁 Long-term learner behaviour.

***

### 4️⃣ Literature Survey

- 📈 DKT and AKT for knowledge tracing.
- 🧩 Cognitive diagnosis models.
- 🤖 RL–based adaptive tutors.

***

### 5️⃣ Methodology & Experimental Plan

- 🧬 Extract cognitive embeddings via deep factor models.
- 🤖 Use RL agent for content sequencing.
- 📉 Predict mastery curves.

#### 🧪 Experiments

- ⚖️ Simulated A/B testing.
- 🚀 Zero-shot learner evaluation.
- 📈 Learning-gain analysis.

***

### 6️⃣ Datasets

- 📚 EdNet
- 📖 ASSISTments
- 📝 Duolingo Dataset

***

### 7️⃣ Expected Contributions

- 🧠 Cognitive-profile-aware adaptive learning system.
